            <h3>Ethan West</h3>
            <p>Ethan West is a Junior at the University of Vermont Majoring in Computer Science. He is an avid climber and has been so for about 4 years. His passion for the sport has inspired this website, putting many hours into the project. At some point hopefully the website will launch and be released to the public, but it has a long way to go before itâ€™s ready. Enjoy!</p>
